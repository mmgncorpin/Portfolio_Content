    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Quite the contradiction of myself, I am an introvert-leaning ambivert. I like to travel and see the world, but can go for days without going out of my house. I like being alone, and being with people I love. </p>
    <p>I'm self-conscious of my body, but I love to cook and eat, and abhor exercise. And speaking of cooking, I'd like to think I'm pretty good at it. I haven't heard complaints yet!</p>
    <p>Career-wise, I've gone through weird paths to get here. Straight out of College, I went into Customer Service, did a short stint in Advertising and Marketing, went back to school to fulfill my mother's dream for me to be a Registered Nurse, got a job as a Company Nurse/Human Resources Associate, became an HR Manager, an Implementations Specialist for an HR-Payroll Software Company, and finally, a Medication Care Manager. Whew!</p>
    <p>I used to blog <a href="https://laineybaby.blogspot.com">here</a>, but completely abandoned it in 2016. Due to boredome, I guess.</p>
    <h2>Why the Career Change?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I finally realized that Nursing is <b><i>NOT</i></b> for me;</li>
        <li>I've worked with Front-End & Back-End Developers, and I thought what they did was so cool!;</li>
        <li>I wanted to learn how to create these sites, viewed across the world;</li>
        <li>I want to find the career I can work with while traveling (or staying at home!);</li>
        <li>I get instant gratification in seeing the output of my "creation."</li>
    </ul>
